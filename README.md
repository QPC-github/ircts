# ircTS
ircTS, or the IRC Test Suite, is our attempt to write a decent client-side IRC server tester. In other words, a piece of software that you can point at a server to make sure it behaves as IRC servers should behave.

This software doesn't make any guarantees about the software tested, but instead simply does its best to alert devs to troubles they can work on.
